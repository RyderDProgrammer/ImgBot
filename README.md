# ImgBot V1.0
ImgBot works online and when a user post a video or image the bot will catalog it into one of the two folders, and then when it is prompted later will grab a random image or
video from that text file.
### As of version 1.0 the bot has a few minor problems that will be worked on in the future.
#### The first big one is that if you put the same picture again it will still add it going to fix that first.
#### Second is that ALL twitter links will be registered to videos still have to figure out how to grab it based on video instead of just a link.
